    <p>
Disruptive technology is an innovation that rearranges the already present norms in the market. It was  popularized by Clayton Christensen in his book published in 1997, The Innovatorâ€™s Dilemma.
Both disruptive technology and disruptive innovation is used. But though the concept of disruptive technology is more widely used, the disruptive innovation concept is more useful as only few technologies are disruptive.
Disruptive technologies include (i) artificial intelligence, (ii) advanced oil & gas exploration and recovery, (iii) renewable energy, (iv) global internet penetration, (v) automation of knowledge work, (vi) 3D printing, (vii) internet of things, (viii) virtual/augmented reality, (ix) next-generation genomics, (x) autonomous and near-autonomous vehicles, (xi) advanced robotics, and (xii) cloud technology.
A disruptive technology is one that displaces an established technology and that creates new industry and new technologies.
these may affect the way a market or industry functions. In some cases, the business models that adapt to new technologies generate new markets and values. This leads to the disruption of well-established companies.
