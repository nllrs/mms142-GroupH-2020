<h2 id="bodyheader"> HOW IS 3D PRINTING DISRUPTIVE? </h2> 
    
<p>
3D Printing is considered as a disruptive technology as it fits the definition of disruptive technologies then discussed, not only affecting the manufacturing industry but even other industries such as that of healthcare and construction to name a few. David F. Flanders specifically stated 4 things that the innovation will affect:<p>
<ol>    
<li>Everyday things – Whereas it is self-explanatory, and that the things we encounter everyday may be reproduced on a lower cost, while possibly still maintaining quality. These include both mass-produced and tailor-made products. 3D Printing also enables customization, to which an item may be reproduced according to one’s specifications.</li> 
<li>Enjoyment of Things – The customizability of 3D Printing ensures that personalization is achievable. This in turn enables said users to “enjoy the products created in 3D printing through their own way”.</li>
<li>“Necessary” Things – This category includes what is considered as our needs and necessities, enabling us to survive and exist. Examples include applications in regards to food, medicine, and shelter.</li>
<li>“World Changing” Things – The last and biggest category out of the four, to which include things that may fundamentally “change the way people do things”, as directly quoted from Flanders. These changes may be in terms of our environment, laws, and economy that 3D Printing may directly or indirectly affect.</li>
</ol>

<p>According to various articles 3D printing can be superior in comparison to traditional manufacturing methods. These include the technology’s flexibility and versatility, to which it enables the use of different materials for different uses and applications; efficiency, to which 3D printing can drastically reduce production timelines while producing less waste; and quality, whereas the step-by-step assembly that the technology entails ensures better and more consistent quality control (Makerbot; Burrus).</p>

<p>3D printing would not completely render currently existing manufacturing methods obsolete, the two instead working hand-in-hand with each other. However, Freddie Dawson (2020) stated that the innovation would have adverse effects on the economic market. Not only it would affect manufacturing sectors, but even changes within the retail and the supply chain would be observable in the future. As 3D printing become more affordable, there would be less reliance on the labor market, at the same time giving greater access to means of production for everyone; competition within the manufacturing industry increasing as even home-based businesses are given the power to produce limited production runs. </p>

<h2 id="bodyheader"> EXAMPLES OF 3D PRINTING AS A DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY </h2> 
<p>Over the past decade, 3D printing has developed from a process that is mainly available to major factories to one that can be done in the home office. It is becoming increasingly more affordable and provides a simple means of producing goods. However, the ethics, legalities, and morals of 3D printing are becoming increasingly relevant as the speed of innovation exceeds the regulation. The following embeded media show various examples of 3D printed products and the affected industry entailed. </p>
